### Hi there 👋
<!-- [![Jacob's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=jpoly1219&show_icons=true&theme=radical)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats) -->

My research interests lie in cultivating better developer tools and DX using concepts from Programming Languages Theory, AI, Software Engineering, and HCI.

Some of these efforts include:
- Creating a Next Edit prediction feature, using AI models to make edit decisions instead of being limited by FIM autocomplete.
- Statically contextualizing LLMs with typed holes and semantic information, improving code completion accuracy and token efficiency.
- Decoupling the LSP client from the editor to efficiently feed relevant context to the LLM.
- Implementing new language server protocols and editor features to facilitate LLM-driven development, even for low-resource languages.
- Writing portable, complex evaluation suites using custom types over primitive types.
- Formally verifying critical operations such as SQL query rewrites.
- Creating AI-based tools for developers.

## Career
- 📚 I'm a PhD student at UC Irvine, researching the future of software engineering.
- 🚀 I worked as a software engineer intern at Continue, amplifying developers with curated AI tools amidst the fears of AI taking over developers.
- 〽️ I graduated from the University of Michigan College of Engineering with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
- 🚀 I worked as founding engineer at Ace AI, creating the cloud-based infrastructure for the organization and working on core AI services such as PII cleaning, synthetic data generation, and codebase analysis.
- 👨‍💻 I worked as a research software engineer and a student research assistant in the Future of Programming Lab at the University of Michigan, creating [ChatLSP](https://fplab.github.io/chatlsp/) (the augmented language server protocol for LLM-friendly methods) and researching static contextualization of LLMs and the further developer tooling ecosystem. Read the paper [here](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3689728).
- 👨‍💻 I worked as a student research assistant in the Michigan Intelligent Programming Lab at the University of Michigan, formally verifying SQL rewrite rules using the Lean theorem prover.
- 👨‍💻 I worked as a full-stack software engineer at the Educational Technology Collective Lab at the University of Michigan School of Information, working on LLM-based educational technology.
- 📰 I worked as a Managing Online Editor at The Michigan Daily, leading a team of 20 engineers. Previously, I was a software engineer working on internal tools, backend, and infrastructure.
- 🫡 I was a squad leader of the Computer Emergency Response Team as a Sergeant in the Republic of Korea Army, managing servers and carrying out field infrastructure missions.
