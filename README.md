My research interests lie on cultivating better developer experience using concepts from Programming Languages Theory, AI, Software Engineering, and HCI.

Some of these efforts include:
- Statically contextualizing LLMs with typed holes and semantic information, improving code completion accuracy and token efficiency.
- Decoupling the LSP client from the editor-space to efficiently feed relevant context to the LLM.
- Implementing new language server protocols and editor features to facilitate LLM-driven development, even for low-resource languages.
- Writing portable, complex evaluation suites using custom types over primitive types.
- Formally verifying critical operations such as SQL query rewrites.
- Creating AI tools for developers.

## Career
- üë®‚Äçüíª I'm a research software engineer and a student research assistant in the Future of Programming Lab at the University of Michigan, creating ChatLSP (augmented langauge server protocol for LLM-friendly methods), and researching static contextualization of LLMs and developer tooling ecosystem.
- üë®‚Äçüíª I'm a student research assistant in the MIPL Group at the University of Michigan, formally verifying SQL rewrite rules in Lean.
- üë®‚Äçüíª I worked as a software engineer intern in the Educational Technology Collective Lab at the University of Michigan School of Information, working on LLM-based learning tools.
- üì∞ I'm a Managing Online Editor at The Michigan Daily. Previously, I was a software engineer working on internal tools, backend, and infrastructure.
- ü´° I was a squad leader of the Computer Emergency Response Team as a Sergeant in the Republic of Korea Army, managing servers and carrying out field infrastructure missions.
- „ÄΩÔ∏è I'm a junior majoring in Computer Science at the University of Michigan College of Enginnering.
