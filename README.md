My research interests lie in cultivating better developer experience using concepts from Programming Languages Theory, AI, Software Engineering, and HCI.
My focus as a software engineer is full-stack development with an emphasis on backend and reliable AI-based services.

Some of these efforts include:
- Statically contextualizing LLMs with typed holes and semantic information, improving code completion accuracy and token efficiency.
- Decoupling the LSP client from the editor to efficiently feed relevant context to the LLM.
- Implementing new language server protocols and editor features to facilitate LLM-driven development, even for low-resource languages.
- Writing portable, complex evaluation suites using custom types over primitive types.
- Formally verifying critical operations such as SQL query rewrites.
- Creating AI-based tools for developers.

## Career
- üöÄ I'm a founding engineer at Ace AI, creating the cloud-based infrastructure for the organization and working on core AI services such as PII cleaning, synthetic data generation, and codebase analysis.
- üë®‚Äçüíª I'm a research software engineer and a student research assistant in the Future of Programming Lab at the University of Michigan, creating ChatLSP (the augmented language server protocol for LLM-friendly methods) and researching static contextualization of LLMs and the further developer tooling ecosystem. Read the paper [here](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3689728).
- üë®‚Äçüíª I'm a student research assistant in the Michigan Intelligent Programming Lab at the University of Michigan, formally verifying SQL rewrite rules using the Lean theorem prover.
- üë®‚Äçüíª I worked as a full-stack software engineer at the Educational Technology Collective Lab at the University of Michigan School of Information, working on LLM-based educational technology.
- üì∞ I worked as a Managing Online Editor at The Michigan Daily. Previously, I was a software engineer working on internal tools, backend, and infrastructure.
- ü´° I was a squad leader of the Computer Emergency Response Team as a Sergeant in the Republic of Korea Army, managing servers and carrying out field infrastructure missions.
- „ÄΩÔ∏è I'm a senior majoring in Computer Science at the University of Michigan College of Engineering.
